You are getting lazy. Who is that girl. You! You are that girl. What are you saying? Roohi! It's the truth. I'm stunned that you chose my elder brother over me because of his money. You won't separate me from yourself, Right? Never! We both will be together forever. Only death can separate us. There will be some work! That's why love is being showed. Or it can be money. That's true, right? It's not about that! You are thinking wrong. I and Bina.. Don't say Bina! Call her sister in law. It's enough that you call her sister in law. You should not tell her to call me that. Please! Why shouldn't I? I respect you! I want everyone to respect you because you deserve it. But Roohi ignores me on purpose. It's just that she doesn't like your respect in this house. Whatever! Why didn't you go to your university? I was worried! Are you sick? Brother is calling? You should talk. Why didn't you wake me up? You slept late! I didn't want to disturb you. What happened? Why are you so quite? No! Are you worried about something? No! Fine! Stay ready in the evening. Why? I told you that Faraz has invited us on a dinner. Oh! I forgot. What about my dress? Don't worry about it. I've selected it already. I've hanged your dress separately. The jewelery is on dressing table. You happy? Yes! OK! Goodbye!  Goodbye! Aunt won't agree like this. She is a mother and has a soft heart! I should try to trap her emotionally.. Are you going? Yes! I wanted to say goodbye. I'll drop you! No Annu! I don't want to disturb you. Don't act formal with me! I'll meet Aunt too! Let's go! Sit down! Why are you standing? You have forgotten us aunt. You haven't visited our house from so many days. I missed you a lot. I thought that I should come myself and meet you. Dropping her was just an excuse. You are not just an aunt to me! You are a mother to me. I love you equally. But you don't think of me as a daughter. If you did! You wouldn't delay my marriage like this. Mothers only want to see their daughters happy! They want them to get married. But.. Still aunt! I'm not mad at you. Because a mother can never be blamed. Take care! Listen! Greetings!  Greetings! Is everything fine? You look worried. I sat with Umer! He didn't say a word! He was just listening. I'm scared because of his behavior. Don't worry! He won't go anywhere. Brother won't let him leave. I cant see your daughter in laws! Where are they? Bina just cooked some food. Roohi didn't want to do anything! I didn't see her from evening. You are too easy with them. Should I beat them? It should be like this. Asad! What am I listening too? What? Mother is sitting here all alone! Roohi can't come out of her room? There's another daughter in law in this house too. Yes! You are right! I mean that Bina attends her university and looks after kitchen in the evening. Roohi is always in the house. That's why I said it! I'm caring about my mother! When I came back from boutique. Mother was having a headache. I was worried. Asad! When a person is alone. He thinks with an evil mind. That's why I asked you. If you felt bad because of me! I'm really sorry. I won't say anything anymore. No Annu! I didn't mean that. Cut the talk! Everybody lives for themselves. Why would somebody entertain me? Roohi is a nice girl. She takes care of her responsibilities. She cares about my food and medications. Yes! She takes good care. Asad! You need someone to listen to you in such an age. You understand, right? I come back from my boutique and have a conversation with my mother. But she sits alone the whole day! There's no one to listen and talk to her. A person goes into depression in such a way. What do you want? You want her to get sick. What are you saying! May god keep mother safe. I'll go and talk to Roohi. She'll sit with mother. What happened? You forgot something? Don't you remember your promise? Which promise? Remember the things you said before our marriage! You'll take care of mother. I care about my mother in law! I give her food. I give her medications on time. You think that's all! What do you want to say? You'll sit with mother from tomorrow. What do you mean? I don't understand. Roohi! Mother is alone. I don't want her to go in depression! Can't you sit with mother till Annu comes back. Asad! I get tired from the work in the morning. The whole day is spent in handling the kitchen. I just rest a bit in the noon. You can rest in mother's room. Roohi! I just want you to give company to mother. She shouldn't feel lonely. You can't do it for our love. This isn't the way! You get ready in the evening and leave. I made dinner. It's not about food! There are many other responsibilities. It's not just my responsibility to look after mother. I handle the kitchen and look after her. Sister! I attend my university. That's fine! You'll attend mother after you come back from university. I get tired. You think that I don't get tired. Why are you both shouting? Nothing mother! You are speaking so loudly! I can hear you shout. Asad just told you to give me sometime. You are here to scold her. This isn't a hospital that you do shifts. If you can't give me time! You can stay in your rooms. You don't need to worry about me. I thought that I'll have daughter in laws. I'll have some peace in the house! These both sister can't stop fighting with each other. They have disturbed the peace in this house. What was this about? Nothing! I was thinking that I should leave my university. Why do you want to leave. So that I can look after the house. Study isn't important than the house. I know that you like to study! Why do you want to leave your university? Tell me the true reason behind it. Bina! Mother! Are you thinking about Annu? What do you think? I don't have a soft heart? I felt ashamed after I saw tears in her eyes. I felt sad! That I got selfish while thinking about you. What have you decided? What about you? Leave it to God! Why do we forget that god handles everything perfectly. And God cares about us more than 70 mothers combined. God decides the best for you! You are right! My sister in law came here and didn't think about her ego! I should think about it. Hello! Sit! I'll be back. What do you think about your life? You are living such a careless life.  I've told you so many times. Why don't you understand? It's my dream to see you act maturely. Which won't be fulfilled. Just like mother thought that this house will become peaceful after daughter in laws become a part of family. But the peace of this house is getting destroyed. Do you know ? Roohi is also careless like you! She likes to create an issue every other minute. If she feels troubled after handling the household then ask her to stop worrying about it. What are you saying brother? Roohi is always looking after the house from the morning. It's not a big deal to look after the house. Do you even realize how much hurt she hurt our mother. The duty that you gave her! She started to pressurize Bina. She was shouting! Think about it! Think and teach her some manners. Tell her that I don't want to see her creating a trouble in this house. You also don't want it. It's better that you join the office from tomorrow or I'll look for replacement. Bina! Bina! Bina! What happened? Bina! Open your eyes Bina! Why did you go to her? Oh! So Bina complained about me to Junaid? You gave her the chance to do such a thing! Why did you go to her? I needed to! She is also a daughter in law in this house! She should be treated equally in this house. Everyone remembers me for work! And everybody later gives importance to Bina. I felt good after hearing them fight. You are over exaggerating! Yes! Because I have to go through all of this. You don't care Asad! You sleep the whole day and leave with your friends in the evening. My problems can be solved after you become a little serious. Why do you target me? It's a fact! An empty pocket doesn't look good on a fully groomed man. Try to understand me! Get serious for me at least. Please join Junaid's business. Stop crying! I'll do just like you say. Greetings! How are you? Please sit! I hope you're happy. Junaid is caring. Before he got married to you, he had a good business mind! After you came in his life! I can see that he has a caring heart too. He used to be satisfied before marriage! But now he stays happy and satisfied. That's why I suggest you to get married. He is right! Why didn't you marry? There's not a reason behind it. I haven't thought about it. DO you like anyone? No! No idea! Do you have any demands? No demands at all! Bina will get you married! Do you have a girl? If I say yes, then? I'm talking about your cousin! Bina! I'm talking about marriage! Junaid! But it doesn't look good if we say it. Please God! Make Faraz fall in love with Khubsurat! You done praying? May God help us. Do you want to order for yourself? Or the things that we are ordering are fine? Whatever you like! Sure? You stunned, right? It's just like your own house! You can come here anytime. There's nothing about being stunned! Hey! Give some sweets to her. The delay is bad! Give me a date thats near. Annu came to me! I couldn't see the tears in her eyes. My heart was pressurized. I just want to tell you that the daughters should get married as early as possible. Oh! Roohi is here too. Give her the sweets. Greetings! You didn't get us the sweets. Neither did we hear any good news. We thought that we should do it! It's been some time since you got married. We didn't hear any good news. I think! Roohi isn't serious about it. She will after she thinks. When Asad becomes caring too. Asad went to office today! OK! He went today. What about tomorrow? It all depends on his mood. Will you have a tea? Only tea? She'll eat proper lunch! Go and arrange it darling. Fine! The medications are complete! Stay easy. See! I was hungry too! Thank you! You should have ate something from the canteen. I wanted to sit with you and eat! Thats why I didn't have anything. Start eating now! Your sister? Yes! Put it on speaker! Why aren't you home yet? Aunt is here and I'm looking after everything. Where are you? She came to meet me! Can't you see her? She is enjoying and I'm handling the household. She has no responsibilities! She acts like a queen of the house and I'm working like a maid. How are you talking? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with me? Can't anyone see the wrong in her? You were never exhausted by doing some work of house. What now? This is the house of my in laws. I also want to meet you and enjoy with you but my day just passes in the kitchen. I'm working! I'll call later. What is this about? I don't know what has happened to her! She was not like this before. We have distributed the duty too! She looks after the kitchen in the morning. I handle it in the evening. I'll go now! Eat your food! I'll eat later! Sister will need some helping hand. Here's your phone! Thank you! Goodbye!  Goodbye! May God protect them. I hope that you work carefully from now onwards. Brother! I'll finish this project. Trust me brother! There won't be any complains. It's not about complains! It's about you and your life. You are my younger brother! I want you to get settled. This will benefit you. Will you listen to your elder brother? Mother called! She told me to come home. Aunt is here to discuss the date of Annu's marriage. Really? Annu would be happy. Annu and Farhan don't know about it! It's better that they get a surprise from mother and aunt. Sure! Sorry! It's OK! Carry on! Tell me something too! Everything is handled! You can go rest. Sister! Let me make it. Did you both fight? No! You are so innocent. You have a good heart! I'm surprised by Roohi's behavior. Leave it! Tell me one thing! Should I look for your proposal? Why? Why do you want me to get married? Yes! Allow me. Am I allowed? Keep quite and cook! It's good that you came. Yes! Everything good? Yes! Do you want me to help you? You? Yes! I was actually interested in this project personally. Junaid adjusted me to the financial department. If you were interested then why didn't you talk to my brother? I did! He rejected me. Really? Brother is understanding in such cases. Asad! He is good as a brother. But in office he acts a little bossy! You have to stay careful! Junaid doesn't like laziness in work. Whoever it is! That's why I'm asking you that if you need help, do tell me. I know many people linked to such a field. I'll discuss if the need arises. Do help me. Sure! Thank you! Bina! Bina! Bina! What happened Bina? Open your eyes Bina! What happened Bina? Brother! Let's take her to the hospital. I'm going to start the car. Roohi! Roohi ma'am! Bina ma'am has fainted. What? She'll be back in some time. Mother! What happened to Bina? I don't know! She fainted in the kitchen. I think she gets dizzy by working. It's not like that! But Roohi handled everything. Yes! She'll be fine! Don't worry. She'll be back. Quickly get the dinner ready! No! Leave it. It looks bad. I'll feel bad if you leave without eating anything. Go! Get the food. Please help her a little. Please sit! What is wrong with you? Fine! But where did you both go? To decide your wedding date. Mother? Thank you mother! I thought that you won't accept the proposal. I didn't want to. But I decided to accept it because of Annu! Next month it is! Call and ask about Bina! She would feel that they didn't ask! What happened to her? Just a show off and attention. I didn't like her! She is clever. Mother! She is so innocent. Her innocence got a man like Junaid trapped. Don't appreciate her in front of me! Do what I asked you to do. If you hate her so much! Why are you worried about her? I'm not worried! It's something that we have to do to show the world. Everything has happened according to your choice! Why are you still upset? You call it according to me? Those sisters are always looking to mess with my feelings.\n",

three weeks ago  and it's such a blessing to recount a  great Wonder of God three  7am morning press and just in between  the prayers I had a spirit of God said  to me that there is someone that is  beside a dead woman  and then the spirit of God begins to say  to me tell the person to increase the  volume of the food and place that ride  beside the dead woman and as the  testimony was eventually going to enter  and the person said that as soon as they  heard that meanwhile few hours before  the time their mom had just been  confirmed clinically dead  and it didn't make sense that in the  middle of that kind of pain that their  sister was listening to a prayer going  on on the  phone but as soon as the word of  knowledge came to increase the the  volume and place them right beside their  mother and the prayers were going on and  on and on and on  [Music]  [Music]  to come back to life and she  and she didn't come back to life and it  felt like our world was stumbling right  down upon her and then she had questions  on her mind was it true that God said  could it be true that that wasn't God  was it not my mom that God was talking  about and she felt God had really  disappointed them for people of God five  minutes later five minutes later five  minutes later  for the scripture says how many of you  will your children ask for bread and you  will give them Stone  while your children are asked for fish  [Music]  the Bible says and women received their  dead but alive  no longer what the people ask us where  is your god while we were dealing with  that another woman brought in another  testimony and she said before I joined  the morning prayers my husband had been  operated on because of brain cancer and  then she said why coming on the prayer I  think it was totally built up and then  the husband was operated and the husband  was unconscious and the doctor came and  told her I said woman are we really  tried to wider that corridors some  sensitive corridors he said but we  couldn't and he said I'm afraid to tell  you your husband will not recover for  the next six months that is he will  become conscious in the next six months  and he may never

exist and  so the doctor goes for the  brother-in-law and begins to tell the  brother-in-law to Wonder Woman about her  behavior and people  [Music]  is  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  that our people listening to the song  and God is saying right now right now  for the Bible says one Jesus was yet  speaking  he was here speaking  and the woman said I went straight to  where my husband was  [Music]

your  husband recovers the doctors  [Music]  everybody was amazing but this is not  the catch look at the one that blew me  off look at  cry  and the one that made me sad there is no  one like like our God and that is the  fact that when they came to move the man  so that I see you to move the money into  the water they now remove the window  Blitz and the woman was asking why are  you removing the window blades I listen  take the structure and so we need to  move the man out from the window we're  gonna move him out don't forget that the  Xbox said you will not be able to stand  up you

since I've been trusting  God for the fruit of the womb in 2021  our surgery gave a word  that if if you are pregnant you should  put your hand in your belly and I I put  my hand in my stomach I wasn't pregnant  and after he finished making that prayer  he said that the Lord so many women  putting their hands in their tummy even  when they are not pregnant  I'll never forget  I said pregnant women should lay their  hands on your belly some people who were  not pregnant you also need your own  heart out of Faith  the Lord saw you the Lord's all you have  the Lord said Let It Be An Abomination  unto me if I do not honor my name in  your life if I do not honor my name in  your life for doing this for doing this  [Music]  so I claimed it and  and after that I I conceived  after I conceived  the enemy strikes with evil thoughts  giving me evil thoughts telling me that  the old that what happened the last time  is going to repeat itself and as pastor  Jerry will always say that thing you are  afraid of  will not happen that thing you are  afraid of will not happen I don't know  who needs to hear this but the Lord said  I should declare it again that your ears  may hear what you are afraid of will not  happen what you're afraid  but he does not started a good work in  your life so  [Music]  continue my pregnancy Progressive but  the thoughts of what will happen in the  future keep on coming  the devil keep on bringing that thought  to me the more I try to resist it the  more the the thoughts comes and I can  remember on a Sunday on the 12th of  March I can remember I was on streams of  Joy Sunday service pastor Jerry said  that you are afraid of the future you  are afraid of the future the more you  try to to resist the thought of the  enemy you are afraid the enemies are  bringing thoughts to you if you're under  the sound of my voice you're afraid of  the future you've been scared you are  still so scared about the future you are  afraid of what will happen next get on  your knees get on your knees get on your  knees  you are scared of the future you are  afraid you afraid the more you try to  fight it the more it comes back to you  lift up your two hands as your Amen  in seven days it will not be up to seven  days may the Lord prove to you that your  future is secure yeah  may the Lord prove to you that he has  gone ahead in your future you will not  be stranded in the future you will not  go down in the future there are future  of your children you are afraid about is  already secure so that word was for me I  claimed it  and ever since that prayer pastor Jerry  made that prayer I had my peace there  was a prophecy that came pastor Jerry  said that before your next birthday that  the Lord will give you will give you a  testimony that will make you shout for  Joy so April of this year 2023 is my  birthday on the 24th of April it's my  birthday was my birthday and the Lord  blessed us with this beautiful baby on  the 18th of April

course of the prayer you said someone  was having blood coming up from her  breasts and then you canceled it I don't  know who you are and the same way breast  milk comes out of the breast of women  blood is coming out blood is coming out  once you press your breasts blood will  be coming out Lord will come out of your  nipples  once you press it blood will come out  I don't know what the issues are but if  you are the one put it on the live  stream  [Music]  what's this  and I was already on the altar of Fire  the more I prayed  the more I pressed it the more blood was  coming up I was confused so he quickly  sent a message to a friend who I  narrated and I like I sent pictures to  her and she was like okay if I have a  mantle I should just blister my head and  communion I said okay I took the coming  and I decided to keep it so it was time  for a convenient time with you so after  their second communion the third one  which was coming out of answers I  decided to  spray the breasts  [Music]  let's spray it on it and then lo and  behold as soon as we feel the prayer  has stopped I have squeezed and squeezed  and squeezed no blood is coming again  indeed all I want to say is that what  God cannot do on this altar that's not  exist I am a living testimony this is an  instant Miracle thank you  guava Canada does not exist so my name  is Justina and I'm testifying from

that woman that God has shown Mercy  because Jerry this started 2017.  when I took him for my second child  I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant  I noticed a very sharp pain on my lower  abdomen  when I was rushed to the hospital  it of course said ruptured a topic and  it requires  emergency surgery  so it was when I came out from the  theater  Dr told me  see we removed one of the fallopian sea  because it was already ruptured  but the remaining one you have you can  give birth to as many children as you  want  so 2018 God bless me with another baby  2022 October I noticed that sharp pain  again on my lower abdomen  I was rushed to the hospital  doctor said ruptured a topic so  after the surgery when I came out from  the theater I didn't know my family  planned among themselves that they would  not tell me that in many fallopian too  we already  removed so it was it January that my  husband told me he said he called me he  said see that day in the theater and the  doctor sent for me when I came in he  showed me he said see this is the  remaining fallopian tube of your wife  and it needs to be removed my husband  said he told them no problem so February  I joined back on nsppd I noticed a  higher fire on this altar I was hooked  again  so anytime pastor Jerry we prophesy on  a creative Miracles are happening organs  are being restored I will shout amen I  said even if I don't want to give birth  again but there's this joy that every  part of your body is intact  so one day one woman testified  how her fallopian tube were restored  back  daddy my mom called me my dad

beside the dead woman and as the  testimony was eventually going to enter  and the person said  [Music]  and it didn't make sense that in the  middle of the kind of pain that their  sister was listening to a prayer going  on on the phone but as soon as the word  of knowledge came to increase the volume  [Music]  your mother  and the prayers were going on and on and  on and on and on and on and she said  by the time you were done praying  and she said we waited for my mom so  come back to life and she didn't she  didn't come back to life and it felt  like our world was stumbling right down  on her and then she had questions on her  mind was it true that God said could it  be true that there wasn't God was it not  my mom that God was talking about and  she  five minutes later  five minutes later  how many of you will your children ask  for bread and you will give them a stone  how many of you will your children are  [Music]  us  the Bible says and women received their  death  [Music]  we are  in a season of Every Revival  [Music]  a revive  d  [Music]  hearts of the people ask us where is  your god when we were dealing with that  another woman brought in another  testimony and  enjoy the morning prayers my husband had  been operated on because of brain cancer  and then she said why coming on the  prayer  top dead the husband was operated and  the husband was unconscious came and  told her I said woman are we really  tried to  worried us some sensitive corridors he  said but we couldn't and he said I'm  afraid to tell you your husband will not  written he will become conscious in the  next six months and he may never walk he  may never walk he may never walk and the  woman replied  does not exist  Ence  [Music]  the woman said I didn't say that what I  am saying is what God cannot do does not  exist and so the doctor goes to the  brother-in-law and begins to tell the  brother-in-law to Wonder Woman about her  behavior and people of God  few hours  and put the husband and I see you the  woman walks straight up so we are the  husband worship and said to God you are  too faithful to favor I trust you too  much my faith has risen  for the Bible says for  faith is now  listening to the song and God is saying  right now  for the Bible says one Jesus was yet to  begin while he was yet speaking  [Music]  see ya and the woman said I went  straight to where my husband was  name  [Music]  it doesn't make sense  [Music]  in two hours  [Music]\n",

chat  says that was the hacker they say get  oof noob  how do they know I got oofed  wait I feel like I hear something I feel  like it sounds like uh uh like maybe  it's in the in the game I'm listening  maybe they added like some sound effects  in the game or something that's so weird  I'm not sure guys I'm gonna try to pick  up a few more light bulbs and if I hear  that sound again maybe I'll check it out  but I I really don't know what it is  hmm maybe Justin left on like uh the TV  downstairs or something sometimes he'll  do that like he'll be watching um lanky  box on TV and be eating um donuts with  foxy  um and then he'll leave the TV on when  he leaves and it makes my mom really  upset sometimes okay I'm gonna go put in  these light bulbs wait someone in the  chat the hackers saying meet me at the  carts you noob  hey  don't tell me that don't call me a noob  it's not lies  my mom says that to us oh no Green's  here guys I won't get it I promise  nice okay he says

keep hearing  stuff I'm just gonna hop in this cart  over here and get away something about  this seems very sus though  I'm gonna go check out where that sound  came from I feel like I heard like like  a sound or something I'm gonna go check  it out one sec guys  hello  hello  where is that sound coming from  hello I feel like this is where I heard  the sound coming from but the only thing  over here is some lit monkey box merch  from Walmart and Target and it can't be  that oh hey it's foxy hey what's up foxy  how's it going is this your merch  weird that is actually so weird guys  Foxy's here I thought Justin took you to  go to Walmart at Target but I guess not  oh well and there's still this weird box  here like  I'm really not sure where this box came  from it's probably Justin's I'm just  gonna leave it alone but it's very  sturdy very nice guys all right I'm just  gonna finish and beat this game  okay guys so in Rainbow friends you  actually want to collect a bunch of the  light bulbs go  check  so check this out guys check this out  what a noob what a noob what I feel like  I hear something guys  I feel like I I definitely or maybe it  was in the game did they add a sound  effect in the game it sounded like  someone was saying like a noob or  something  that's so weird  he says I will skippity toilet flush you  noob  no  guys that is actually a super super big  fear of mine so Justin has already  talked about justin.exe and lankybox.exe  but apparently Justin at 3am has  actually been finding scubody toilet and  it's super super scary we'll put a  little clip on screen of what the  skippity toilet looks like he says I  will skippity toilet flush you  [Music]  computer oh  he actually  what does that mean  it's not 3 A.M what does that even mean  that's what you do no it's not guys no  it's not no it's not  that's alive that's actually a lie that  is simply not true they say take this  noob  take whoa  wait  guys  this thick shark plushie literally came  in like that like it came from the  ceiling wait hold on  they said take this Noob and get danced  on noob  [Music]  wait how did they know  that I would have this plushie like fall  on me in real life  how  did you know that there was gonna be a  plushie that fell on me that so sus like  the timing is so weird like  did you hack my brain  I wonder or I hacked your mommy  my mommy  food  are you kidding me  no guys no  skippity Mom Mom yes yes yes  wait hold on I definitely hear laughing  wait is Justin actually home  hold on maybe he's in his room or  something oh look at you had a big 4K  let me go check uh around the lanky box  house and see if Justin's actually here  hold on guys  [Music]  4K no I guess he's not here huh  [Music]  so weird guys okay so Foxy's here boxy  the boy super lit and then Foxy's here  just taking a nap on her lanky box uh  pillow that she got from  lankyboxshop.com that's actually so cool  now what's awesome guys is sometimes  when Justin's not here and my mom's not  here I'll whisper secrets to the plushie  so guys listen up foxy unboxing I'm  actually gonna tell you who I have a  crush on but you gotta promise not to  tell Justin okay yeah yeah Okay cool so  I actually have a big crush on the cyan  rainbow friend  wow cool yeah guys but make sure to not  tell Justin okay that's a big secret I  just think they're really really cool  and I just got a little bit of a crush  on them okay got it guys make sure to  keep that a secret okay I'm gonna leave  them right here and I'm gonna get back  to playing right now friends hey we got  it we got him now we got him now oh man  wake up now we got all of that we got  them now so guys how you beat the  rainbow friends is you actually just  have to collect a bunch of items hidden  around the map which is a lot of fun so  I'm actually gonna finish putting in um  all these light bulbs oh gotta watch out  for green I don't want to get grabbed by  Green that would be super super scary  but wait a minute I just realized if the  hacker holds on to some of the light  bulbs then I can't even win  he says I bet you want to get grabbed by  cyan  I mean yeah but wait  how did he know that no I why would you  say that  he says I caught you in 4k what do you  what does that even mean  one two buckle my shoe three four  catch you in 4k that didn't even run  time that didn't even rhyme hacker I got  a video of you in 4k you said you like  cyan  wait a minute guys I  I said that I like cyan I had a crush on  saying but I only told that to the  plushies they're saying Adam and cyan  sitting in a tree oh no get a hoof now  oh  oh  f-f-i-n-g guys that's what I'm doing I'm  oofing that's crazy that blue actually  just got me I'm going back to the carts  where did that hacker go  because I feel like  I definitely hear something hold on hold  on hold on hold on guys wait a minute  wait a minute guys  let me go check something out really  quick  hello  oh  [Music]  hello  foxy foxy  guys it's so sus because I definitely  hear like some laughter or something and  it sounds like just  [Music]  wait a minute guys  wait I actually think Justin might be  home  I'm not sure I'm not totally sure yet  guys but I feel like he might be  in this box  wait is Justin actually the hacker  no no no he couldn't be the hacker he's  at Walmart and Target  hmm guys I'm gonna I'm gonna just beat  this level of rainbow friends  and I'm gonna find out who actually is  this hacker maybe it's actually  justin.exe oh no okay guys I gotta beat  this level I have to beat this level  okay no no man I gotta with my blue  again  I do feel like I'm getting closer I have  a feeling  I have a feeling guys the hacker is  either the skivity toilet or it's  justin.exe or some type of a mix  maybe it's justin.exe merged with the  skibety toilet  I'm not sure guys but I I do feel like  I'm getting closer to revealing the  identity of this hacker  I'm not sure though they're saying in  the chat Adam and cyan sitting in a tree  don't type the rest do not type the rest  guys every time  someone says that they're sitting in a  tree it's normally followed by oh man  man I gotta do my blue  he says Noob Noob no no I'm not a noob  no I'm not I'm not a noob I'm not a noob  yeah guys normally it's um like  something something sitting in a tree  h-u-g-g-i-n-g he says you're gonna cry  to your mommy no I'm not gonna I'm gonna  cry to my mommy guys I would never do  that  I'm learning to be very very brave  okay  man I I can't get Oath by Blue again  Blue's like so close to getting me if I  just make one mistake I'm literally  oofed here on all the hackers here  come on man there's a noob again  I'll show you hacker check this out guys  I'm gonna use the zip line to get to  Blue's Castle again and I'm gonna I'm  gonna talk  here we go guys check this out  they're saying I'm gonna leak your  biggest secret  no that  [Music]  oh wait there's no way you don't know my  secret you
